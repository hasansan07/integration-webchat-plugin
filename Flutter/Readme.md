## WEBCHAT WEBVIEW - ANDROID & IOS INTEGRATION IN FLUTTER!


•	“webview_flutter” package is installed in the flutter project. (last version recommended)

•	“web_view_stack.dart” file is created.

#### ! IMPORTANT: Webview basic configuration and webview usage structure is entirely designed by the customer. Only an example webview is shared in the document.

•	Since some android versions are also needed, following permissions to the AndroidManifest.xml file under android/src/main is added.

•	After permissions added, “WebViewStack" in our main.dart file is used.

(This is just an example, creating and styling the button is on customer side, since it is purely flutter development and has nothing to do with chat plugin.)
